# hello-world

Hello everyone.

This is my first Git repository, as I learn how to use GitHub.

As I progress through my self-taught coding journey, I'll post my progress here.

I intend to use this as:

- A motivational diary tool to inspire me to write new code every day.
- A safebox for my work.
- A record of my improvement.
- A resource for revision.
- A showcase for my (eventual) achievements.
- A store of useful code snippets.

I can be reached on simonjordan557@aol.com.
